### Instructions
Above you will see a preview of the slide deck for this lesson, along with a link called ```Slide Deck``` to open it in a new tab. 

Both the ```Slide Deck``` and ```Foundations of HTML``` below have the same content, just presented in slightly different ways. 

Clicking ```Foundations of HTML``` will take you to slide by slide breakdown of this lesson.

While ```Slide Deck``` will open the slides themselves. 

Good Luck!
